## Project Description

The goal of this repository is to gather all the programs and algorithms created during my studies in the "Data Structures and Algorithms" course. It contains various solutions to problems and implementations of data structures that illustrate the knowledge and skills I have acquired.

### Mars Expedition Problem

The problem at hand involves selecting a crew for a manned mission to Mars. The main organizer of the expedition needs to solve the following problem:

There are five astronauts (k1, k2, k3, k4, k5) who have successfully passed the preliminary qualification for participation in the expedition. On board the special spaceship, at least one specialist from each of the following fields is required: A, B, C, and D.

The specialization of the astronauts is as follows:
- **Field A**: k1, k4
- **Field B**: k2, k3, k4
- **Field C**: k3, k5
- **Field D**: k1, k2, k5

Due to limited space on the spaceship, the aim is to choose the smallest possible group of astronauts that includes at least one specialist in each of the fields A, B, C, and D.

### GPD Prediction Problem

In 1998, Poland's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was $6,000, and the GDP growth rate was maintained at 6 percent per year. Assuming that the GDP growth rate in Poland remains at the same level in the following years, how many years will it take for Poland's GDP to double? In 1998, Germany's GDP was $12,000, and the GDP growth rate was 1.2 percent per year. Assuming that the GDP growth rate in Germany remains at the same level in the following years, is there a chance that Poland's GDP will equal Germany's GDP within the next 20 years?
